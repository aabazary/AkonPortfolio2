## Akon Portfolio:

HTML CSS Bootstrap

An updated Portfolio Page. I wanted to practice Bootstrap a bit more so I redid the page using Bootstrap. There is a NavBar that becomes a hamburger button in mobile mode. The buttons will draw down to the location on the page. The contact me currently doesn't work but will eventually email the form. Social links in footer.
